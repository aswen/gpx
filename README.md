## Intro
This repo keeps track of GPS tracks and POI files we create.
I endeavour to create some very good POI files of Campsites and will provide
tracks of holidays we had and complete tracks of walking and cycling routes we
followed or want to follow.

## Usage
I hope these files are useful for anyone who plans a trip. The trips we've made
thusfar were awesome and I hope anyone enjoys them like we did.
We did not visit all campsites in the POI files. There might be campsites among
them that are absolutely worthless.
I own a Garmin Oregon 450t GPS and that's the only one I know how to place use
files on. You can do so by connecting the gps to a pc and then copy any .gpx
file into the folder GPS-volume:/Garmin/GPX.

## Contributing
Please help me by creating pull requests with updates of campsites!
