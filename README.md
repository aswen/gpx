## Intro
This repo keeps track of GPS tracks and POI files we create.
I endeavour to create some very good POI files of Campsites and will provide
tracks of holidays we had and complete tracks of walking and cycling routes we
followed or want to follow.

## Usage
I hope these files are useful for anyone who plans a trip. The trips we've made
thusfar were awesome and I hope anyone enjoys them like we did.
We did not visit all campsites in the POI files. There might be campsites among
them that are absolutely worthless.
I own a [Garmin Oregon 450t][oregon] GPS and that's the only one I know how to place use
files on. You can do so by connecting the gps to a pc and then copy any .gpx
file into the folder GPS-volume:/Garmin/GPX.

## Filetypes
As Garmin user I am stick to the GPX file format. I try to copy most tracks to
the Google maps KML format as well. These files however might be less uptodate
than the GPX files.

## Contributing
Please help me by creating pull requests with updates of campsites!

## Software
A word on software to create and review tracks and maps. At the time I bought my
GPS I was using the [Garmin Mapsource][mapsource] software but as it ran under
Windows I searched for some Linux variants. I have to admit that I never found a
proper solution to create GPX track files as easy as mapsource does. At the
moment I try to find out the secrets of [Quantum GIS][qgis] but that's not easy.
To view files however Googleearth is great when they're [converted][gpsbabel]
into KML format.
Also there's [GPX-viewer][gpxviewer] but atm it won't load any
[OpenStreetMap][osm] map.
There a big load of software for Linux but I still haven't found what I'm
looking for.
