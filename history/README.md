## Intro
This repo keeps track of GPS tracks and POI files we actually cycled or walked.
It's our personal hall of fame. Each of these tracks was a pleasure to follow
and we encourage everybody to follow up our tracks.

## Usage
I own a Garmin Oregon 450t GPS and that's the only one I know how to place use
files on. You can do so by connecting the gps to a pc and then copy any .gpx
file into the folder GPS-volume:/Garmin/GPX.

## Contributing
This dir contains tracks made by members of my family exclusively.
